# Development Guide: meridian-channel

There are no users and there is no real user data. No need for backwards compatibility. It's okay to completely change the schema to get it into the right shape.

## Philosophy

**Meridian-Channel** is a coordination layer for multi-agent systems—not a file system, execution engine, or data warehouse.

### Core Principles

1. **Harness-Agnostic**: Same `meridian` commands work across Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, **etc.** (extensible to future harnesses) for both primary agents and subagents, with per-harness adapters
2. **Files as Authority**: All state lives in files under `.meridian/.spaces/<space-id>/`. No database. `space.json` for space metadata, `runs.jsonl` for run events, `sessions.jsonl` for session tracking. Atomic writes via tmp+rename, `fcntl.flock` for concurrency.
3. **Explicit Over Implicit**: MERIDIAN_SPACE_ID required; no auto-creation or implicit context
4. **Agent Profiles Own Skills**: Static skill definitions in agent profiles, loaded fresh on agent launch/resume
5. **Minimal Constraints**: Agents organize `.meridian/.spaces/<space-id>/fs/` however they want; Meridian provides container only

### Architecture

- **Space**: Self-contained agent ecosystem with primary + child agents, shared filesystem. Two states: `active` and `closed`.
- **Primary Agent**: Entry point (any harness), launched via `meridian start`
- **Agent Profile**: YAML markdown defining capabilities, tools, model, skills
- **Skill**: Domain knowledge/capability loaded fresh on launch/resume (survives context compaction)
- **State Layer**: `src/meridian/lib/state/paths.py` (path resolution), `src/meridian/lib/state/run_store.py` (JSONL run events), `src/meridian/lib/space/space_file.py` (space.json CRUD), `src/meridian/lib/space/session_store.py` (session tracking)

## Development

```bash
# Install from source
uv sync --extra dev

# Run tests with token-efficient output (preferred for agents)
uv run pytest-llm

# Type check
uv run pyright
```

### Long-Running Tasks

For multi-phase plans, use the `/orchestrate` skill and NEVER write implementation code yourself. It discovers available skills, picks the right model for each subtask, and composes runs via `run-agent.sh`. See the orchestrate skill's SKILL.md for full details.

Prefer to use `gpt-5.3-codex` for the majority of the tasks because its faster and cheaper than opus usually. Make sure you give these run-agents enough context to do their job.

### Planning

Make sure you use the `/mermaid` skill to plan your work. It will help you write plans in markdown format. Using `/orchestrate` and multiple agents to review-cycle through the plan can help you catch issues early and get a better plan.

### Commit Checkpoints

**Commit after each step that passes tests.** Don't accumulate changes across multiple steps — if a later step breaks things, you lose the ability to roll back cleanly. Each step's commit should be atomic and self-contained:
1. Implement the step (via `/run-agent`)
2. Verify tests pass (via `/run-agent` or directly)
3. Commit with a descriptive message
4. Move to the next step

### Never Delete Untracked Files

**NEVER delete or remove untracked files without asking the user first.** Untracked files may be the user's in-progress work. If you need to clean up files you believe are stale:
1. Ask the user before deleting
2. If you must proceed, `git stash --include-untracked` first so the work is recoverable
3. When reverting codex agent changes with `git checkout`, check `git status` for untracked files the agent created vs. untracked files that existed before — only clean up agent-created files after confirming with the user
